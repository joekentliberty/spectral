				<h6>Freedom to Marry</h6>
				<p><a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">www.freedomtomarry.org</p>
				<p>Freedom to Marry is the campaign working to win marriage nationwide. We partner with a diverse range of organizations and supporters across the country to end the exclusion of same-sex couples from the responsibilities, protections, and commitment of marriage.</p>
				<h5>Achievements</h5>
				<blockquote>Freedom to Marry was the campaign to win marriage nationwide. With the Supreme Court victory on June 26, 2015, the work of this strategic campaign – though not the larger movement – was achieved, and Freedom to Marry wound down its operations, closing in early 2016.</blockquote>
