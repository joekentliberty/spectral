	<h3>Gay Chicago</h3>
	<p>Speaking of Chicago, we can not ignore its vibrant gay scene and its fastest growing gay populations in the country. Chicago is famous for its Boystown, the world’s most “Incomparable Gay Neighborhood”. Boystown Chicago is situated just southeast of Wrigleyville in Lakeview, it is the first officially recognized gay village in the United States.</p>
	<p>Chicago has a vibrant gay bar scene, but not all of gay bars, clubs are in Boystown. You will find some nice and cool gay bars scattered in Chicago.  If you are not a Boystown fan, then places like uptown, Lake View and Rogers Park provides some gay bars that are as good as those in Boystown. </p>
