	<h3>Libertarian Position on Gay Marriage</h3>
	<p>We welcome anyone who believes in individual liberty and who wishes to actively promote gay rights. Believing in minimum government, maximum Freedom. The critical spirit never knows when to stop meddling. -- Mason Cooley</p>
	<p>We works to improve the lives of gay men worldwide by advocating for equal rights of gay marriage. Gay marriage should have access to all the benefits enjoyed by different-sex couples. Gay marriage is protected by the US Constitution's commitments to liberty and equality. Denying some people the option to marry is discriminatory. </p>
